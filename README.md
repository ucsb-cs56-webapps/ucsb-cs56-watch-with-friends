 "spring.data.mongodb.port":"<port>",
 "spring.data.mongodb.username":"<username>"
}
```
Afterwards, the commands to run are :

Technical things to know: Learn how the [@ResponseBody](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-request-response-body) works, and how to use the [MongoRepository](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/repository/MongoRepository.html).

Holistic things to know:  Work with your team, keep each other in check, attempt to understand the project as a group, and prepare time to overcome technical challenges.

~~Bugs~~ Features: When first creating a room on the webapp, the error page is called. However, subsequent creations of rooms will permanently work.

Features to add: Realtime-chat, Music sharing options, User accounts (personalization), Improved security, Syncing of videos, and a way to monitor current sessions.

What we used for this app:  
Spring-Boot
Herokuapp
MongoDB with MLab
Maven

The app is meant to create new or join existing rooms created by the app. Each room is uniquely identified by a name and hash. Existing room names cannot be created, but there is no way at the moment to stop users from simply entering the room that they guessed -- This could be a new issue to attempt. The code is divided into two parts: the User Interface (resources files) and Database (predominantly the java files). The way the two are connected is through the WatchController, which delivers response bodies to the html as well as makes calls to the database. Once you gain understanding of this process, continuing the app will be the next step. Good luck.
